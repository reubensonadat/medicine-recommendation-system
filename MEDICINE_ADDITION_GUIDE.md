## üîó Step 6: Configure Symptom Mappings

This is the most important part - it connects your medicine to symptoms!

### Symptom Mapping Structure:

```json
{
  "symptomId": "symptom-id",
  "effectivenessScore": 8,
  "isPrimary": true,
  "evidenceLevel": "Strong",
  "notes": "Effectiveness notes"
}
```

### Mapping Fields:

| Field | Description | Valid Values |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `symptomId` | **Must match** an ID from symptoms.json | `"headache"`, `"fever"`, etc. |
| `effectivenessScore` | Effectiveness rating (1-10) | `1` (ineffective) to `10` (very effective) |
| `isPrimary` | Is this a primary use for the medicine? | `true` or `false` |
| `evidenceLevel` | Strength of clinical evidence | `"Strong"`, `"Moderate"`, `"Weak"`, `"Theoretical"` |
| `notes` | Additional effectiveness notes | `"First-line treatment for fever"` |

### Guidelines for Symptom Mappings:

1. **Use Real symptomIds**: Always reference IDs from `/public/symptoms.json`
2. **Be realistic with scores**: 
   - `1-3`: Poor effectiveness
   - `4-6`: Moderate effectiveness  
   - `7-8`: Good effectiveness
   - `9-10`: Excellent effectiveness
3. **Primary vs Secondary**: 
   - `isPrimary: true` for main uses
   - `isPrimary: false` for secondary/beneficial effects
4. **Evidence Levels**:
   - `"Strong"`: Well-established clinical evidence
   - `"Moderate"`: Good clinical evidence
   - `"Weak"`: Limited clinical evidence
   - `"Theoretical"`: Theoretical/research-based only

## üìä Step 7: Example - Adding Paracetamol

      "effectivenessScore": 10,
      "isPrimary": true,
      "evidenceLevel": "Strong",
      "notes": "Highly effective for malaria-related fever"
    },
    {

}
```

## ‚úÖ Step 9: Add to Medicines JSON

1. Open `/public/medicines.json`
2. Add your new medicine to the `medicines` array
3. **Ensure proper JSON formatting** (commas, brackets, etc.)
4. Save the file

### Important Notes:
- Use a unique ID (check existing medicines first)
- Maintain alphabetical order by brand name if possible
- Ensure proper comma placement between array items
- Validate JSON syntax before saving

## üß™ Step 10: Validate Your Addition

Run the validation script again:

```bash
npm run validate-data
```

This will catch any issues with your new medicine entry.

## üöÄ Step 11: Test the Medicine

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

3. Test your new medicine:
   - Search for it in the browse tab
   - Select symptoms it should treat
   - Check if it appears in recommendations
   - Click "View Details" to see the medicine details page
   - Test all filters (category, drug class, etc.)

## üîç Common Issues and Solutions

### ‚ùå "Symptom not found" error
**Problem**: You used a `symptomId` that doesn't exist in `symptoms.json`
**Solution**: Check `/public/symptoms.json` for valid symptom IDs

### ‚ùå "No recommendations found" 
**Problem**: Medicine has incorrect symptom mappings or effectiveness scores
**Solution**: Verify symptom mappings are correct and scores are realistic

### ‚ùå "Medicine details not loading"
**Problem**: Missing required fields or JSON syntax error
**Solution**: Run validation script and check JSON formatting

### ‚ùå "Duplicate ID" error
**Problem**: You used an ID that already exists
**Solution**: Use a unique ID (check existing medicines first)

### ‚ùå "Category not found" error
**Problem**: You used a category that doesn't exist
**Solution**: Use one of the predefined categories listed in this guide

### ‚ùå "Drug class not found" error
**Problem**: You used a drug class that doesn't exist
**Solution**: Use one of the predefined drug classes listed in this guide

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Start with existing medicines**: Use existing entries as templates
2. **Be conservative with scores**: It's better to underestimate effectiveness
3. **Provide detailed information**: More details help users make informed decisions
4. **Include safety warnings**: Always include important safety information
5. **Use realistic pricing**: Use actual Ghanaian price ranges
6. **Consider local context**: Ensure medicines are relevant to Ghanaian healthcare
7. **Test thoroughly**: Always test new additions before deploying
8. **Document sources**: Keep notes on your evidence sources for effectiveness ratings
